### GitHub seems like the perfect solution for creating a simple website in markdown. 
 * You can create code using markdown
 * You can upload images that you would like to display on your webpages
 * Simple to get started 
 * Advanced features that we will use if you take CMST385: Website Design

The markdown document you create can be viewed and edited in a web browser 
and all data entered is stored on the web server. 
Limited Formatting of text can be done using simple *Markdown* characters, 
which are more concise but less capable then *HTML Markup*. 

To get started go to the **[Assignment 3 – Website Markdown](Asgn3-Markdown.pdf)** by clicking on this [link](Asgn3-Markdown.pdf). 
You can write in English or 日本語 or any other language you wish.
